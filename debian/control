Description: boot animation, logger and I/O multiplexer
 Plymouth provides a boot-time I/O multiplexing framework - the most obvious
 use for which is to provide an attractive graphical animation in place of
 the text messages that normally get shown during boot. (The messages are
 instead redirected to a logfile for later viewing.) However, in event-driven
 boot systems Plymouth can also usefully handle user interaction such as
 password prompts for encrypted file systems.
 .
 This package provides the basic framework, enabling a text-mode animation.

Description: boot animation, logger and I/O multiplexer - themes
 Plymouth provides a boot-time I/O multiplexing framework - the most obvious
 use for which is to provide an attractive graphical animation in place of
 the text messages that normally get shown during boot. (The messages are
 instead redirected to a logfile for later viewing.) However, in event-driven
 boot systems Plymouth can also usefully handle user interaction such as
 password prompts for encrypted file systems.
 .
 This package provides the following themes:
 .
  * fade-in: features a centered logo that fades in and out while stars twinkle
    around the logo during system boot up.
  * glow: features a pie chart as progress indicator.
  * script: features a simple base theme.
  * solar: features a blue flamed sun with animated solar flares.
  * spinfinity: features a centered logo and animated spinner that spins in the
    shape of an infinity sign.
  * spinner: features a simple theme with a small spinner on a dark background.
